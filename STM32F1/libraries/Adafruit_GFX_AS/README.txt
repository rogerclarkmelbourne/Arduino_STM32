This library has minor modifications to support STM32.
It also was modified to include additional fonts.

This is the core graphics library for all our displays, providing a common set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.).  It needs to be paired with a hardware-specific library for each display device we carry (to handle the lower-level functions).
